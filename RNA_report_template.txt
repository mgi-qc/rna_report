Data quality report for work order: ${WOID}

QC Pass Metrics
Alignment Rate: 0.70 for human (0.60 for mouse)
No other metric required/reviewed for assignment of QC pass/fail judgement

Additional Reviewed Metrics (preferred thresholds):
% rRNA bases (PCT_RIBOSOMAL_BASES): ≤ 0.05
Coding + UTR + Intronic(PCT_SUM): ≥ 0.75
ERCC Mix1 Control: Correlation coefficient preferred value R^2: ≥ .90
